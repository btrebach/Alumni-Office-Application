Create your local git repository\r\n  - `cd <location>` - go to your own project folder destination on your computer\r\n  - `git init` - this creates the git repository\r\n2. Clone the repository\r\n  - `git clone git@github.com:btrebach/basic-git-tutorial.git`\r\n  - `touch FirstnameLastname.txt`\r\n4. Add files to index\r\n  - `git add FirstnameLastname.txt`\r\n5. Moves the file to the Head\r\n  - `git commit -m 'FirstnameLastname initial commit'`\r\n6. `git status` --> should show the file you just created\r\n  - This shows the difference between the Working Directory (your computer) and the Index (staging area)\r\n7. Push the file to the actual remote repository (on GitHub)\r\n  - `git push origin master`\r\n\r\nBoom, there's your basic workflow.\r\n\r\nIf you have already cloned the repo but run `git status` and see people have added their own files run `git pull origin master` to pull down the latest and greatest.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
